# SYSADM1 -- Platform Services

# Requirement: 

-   A virtual machine running Windows Server

    **Objective/s:**

    To analyze IIS logs in the Event Viewer to identify critical web
    service metrics, understand common error codes, and learn how to
    monitor the health of web applications.

**Instructions**

**Part 1: Opening Event Viewer and Loading Logs**

1.  Access the event viewer in the server.

2.  From the event viewer, explore the windows log and list down its
    major categories:

![](vertopal_4277d020dc9d40528667cec065884077/media/image2.png){width="1.7398261154855643in"
height="1.1251574803149607in"}

*Its major categories are application, security, setup, system, and
forwarded events.*

**Part 2: Filtering and Analyzing IIS Events**

1.  Apply filter to the windows log categories to display errors for the
    past 12 hours.

[Error filter for all categories:]{.underline}

height="2.3649136045494314in"}

[Result:]{.underline}

height="3.7152777777777777in"}

![](vertopal_4277d020dc9d40528667cec065884077/media/image5.png){width="7.027083333333334in"
height="3.0166666666666666in"}

height="0.17847222222222223in"}

[\
]{.underline}*10 errors and 23 warnings identified, with 5 errors and 2
warnings found for the application category while 5 errors and 21
warnings found for the system category.*

2.  **Identify Critical Events** or recurring events.

3.  **Analyze the Events**:

    -   For each critical or recurring event, **record the following
        details**:

        -   **Event ID**

        -   **Source**

        -   **Timestamp**

        -   **Description**

**Part 3: Troubleshooting and Solution Development**

1.  Review the logs and check for recurring errors.

> *The 3 recurring errors I found were event IDs 1014, 34, and 10149.*

2.  Is there a specific time or pattern to these errors?

> *There is no specific time or pattern for event ID 1014 as for event
> ID 34, it seems to happen twice before recurring again. For event ID
> 10149, it only happened twice so I could not conclude any time or
> pattern for it.*

3.  Draft a Troubleshooting Report:

    -   Based on the events found, create a short report with the
        following sections:

**Report Structure**

**1.** Overview

*During the review of the Event Viewer logs from a Windows Server 2012
machine running in a VirtualBox environment, I found that no critical
errors occurred in the past 12 hours. However, there were a total of 33
events logged under the Warning and Error event levels.*

2\. Key Findings

-   List the critical events you found. Example:

    -   ***Event ID 34**: Occurred 6 times between 8:32 am and 8:33 am.
        Disk write cache disabled.*

    -   ***Event ID 1014**: Occurred 10 times between 8:14 am and 8:35
        am. DNS resolution issues.*

    -   ***Event ID 10149**: Occurred 2 times between 8:16 am and 8:32
        am. WinRM service no listening for management requests.*

**3.** Root Causes and Solutions

> *Event ID 34 is likely related to driver related issues, updating the
> drivers should fix the problem. Event ID 1014 is likely related to
> misconfigurations on the DNS server and naming. Rechecking these
> configurations and making sure the right configurations are set should
> be able to take care of this event.*

**Part 4: Reflection Questions**

1.  What are the most common causes of a **503 Service Unavailable**
    error?

2.  How would you **monitor login attempts** to detect potential
    security threats?

3.  Why is **monitoring logs** in Event Viewer important for
    administrators?
